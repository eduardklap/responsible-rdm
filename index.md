This is a new lesson built with [The Carpentries Workbench][workbench]. This lesson is currently (September 2023) under construction. We are in the progress of digitalizing existing materials from the [Responsible Research Data Management](https://www.egsh.eur.nl/doctoral-education/phd-course-guide/responsible-research-data-management-rdm/) and publishing it in this space.

## Welcome
Welcome to the online version of [Responsible Research Data Management](https://www.egsh.eur.nl/doctoral-education/phd-course-guide/responsible-research-data-management-rdm/)! This course is offered at the [Erasmus Graduate School of Social Sciences and the Humanities (EGSH)](https://www.egsh.eur.nl/) at [Erasmus University Rotterdam](https://www.eur.nl/) in the Netherlands. But these online materials are free to use for anyone who wants to learn more about research data management (RDM).

## About the course

Increasingly, researchers are expected to make their research data available, in such a way that it is *as open as possible and as closed as necessary*. Additionally, having a data management plan is required by many stakeholders like funding agencies, ethical review boards, or journals.  

But what does this mean, and how can you put this into practice? What are the practical consequences of research data management (RDM) and how do you handle personal/sensitive data and take care of long-term preservation, access, and reuse of your data? These and related questions about RDM are the topic of this workshop.

We will discuss best practices for documenting, organizing, sharing, and archiving your research data, including personal data and working in international collaboration settings.

Effectively managing data can help to optimise research outputs, increase the impact of your research, and support open scientific inquiry. After completing this course, you will be better equipped to manage your data throughout the entire research data lifecycle, from the stage of project planning to the end.
