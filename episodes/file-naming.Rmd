## Introduction

Good metadata and documentation of projects starts with properly naming the files and folders. Informative file names can be considered a basic but crucial example of metadata.

#### Examples

Here are some examples of good and bad file names:

| :green_square: YES                  | :red_square: NO                                 |

| 20220214_SampleSize_Paper.docx      | Paper.docx                                      |
| Fig01-histogram-flankertask.png     | Figure 1.png                                    |
| analysis01_descriptive-statistics.R | Eduard's filenames Use spaces and punctuation.R |
| gambling_data_processed.csv         | Final_data(1).csv                               |

Can you see why some file names are better than others?

## Three principles for (file) names.

Good file names are:

1.  machine readable
2.  human readable
3.  making sorting and searching easy

### Machine readable: be nice to machines

Keep it simple:

-   Use letters, numbers, hyphens and underscores... that's it

-   Avoid spaces, punctuation, accented characters, case sensitivity

    -   paper_flanker-task_draft01.docx ✅

    -   paper "flanker task" draft01(1).docx ❌

-   Never have two files that differ only in case

    -   Paper ideas.docx ❌
    -   paper ideas.docx ❌

-   Deliberate use of delimiters

    -   Use hyphen `-` to mean "different words that are part of the same chunk"

    -   Use underscore `_` to separate different chunks of metadata

Using delimiters in this way makes it easier for software to recognize the right files for processing, and it also makes it easier to search for files later.

### Example

Here is an example of the use of hyphens and underscores for file names using the [Brain Imaging Data Structure](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/) format:

```         
└─ sub-034/
   └─ ses-01/
      ├─ anat/
      │  └─ sub-034_ses-01_T1w.nii.gz
      │  └─ sub-034_ses-01_T1w.json
      └─ func/
         ├─ sub-034_ses-01_task-feedback_events.tsv
         ├─ sub-034_ses-01_task-feedback_run-1_bold.json 
         ├─ sub-034_ses-01_task-feedback_run-1_bold.nii.gz
         ├─ sub-034_ses-01_task-feedback_run-2_bold.json 
         ├─ sub-034_ses-01_task-feedback_run-2_bold.nii.gz
         ├─ sub-034_ses-01_task-rest_bold.json 
         └─ sub-034_ses-01_task-rest_bold.nii.gz
```

Please forget about the details, but what can be read from the file names above is the following: Each file name consists of a chain of keys (e.g. `sub`, `ses`, `task`, `run`) linked with a hyphen with specific values (e.g. `034`, `01`, `feedback`, `2`), all separated by underscores, and an extension. For instance, file `sub-034_ses-01_task-feedback_run-2_bold.json` contains instances of the `subject`, `session`, `task`, and `run` entities, making it evident from the file name alone that it contains feedback-task data (`task-feedback`) from the first session (`ses-01`) and second run (`run-2`) from subject 034 (`sub-034`).

### Human readable: be nice to humans

For humans, it is important that they can easily to figure out what something is, based on its name. Therefore, the name should contain information about the content of the file.

A very useful way to add informative content to file names is to use a `slug`: a concise, meaningful description, usually appended to the end. Slug is originally newspaper jargon for a short article name or catchline that captures the essence of a story. It is also used as a name for the human-readable end part of the URL in website publishing, made to optimize search engine results to websites (e.g., `https://instance.com/posts/how-to-make-slugs`). Some examples of short slugs for file names in a research project:

-   analysis01\_*descriptive-statistics*.R

-   analysis02\_*preregistered-analysis*.R

-   notes01\_*realising-the-problem*.txt

-   analysis03\_*departing-from-the-plan*.R

-   notes02\_*tentative-write-up*.docx

### Make sorting and searching easy

Put something numeric first to order files

In case of dates, you should follow the YYYY-MM-DD format ([ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) standard) and files can be easily ordered chronologically (if you prefer, YYYYMMDD without hyphens is also fine according to ISO 8601)

-   *2019-01-01*\_original-analysis.R

-   *2019-12-01*\_minor-changes-to-original.R

-   *2022-01-01*\_analysis-at-2-year-follow-up.R

-   *2022-01-02*\_minor-changes-to-follow-up.R

-   *2022-04-01*\_combined-original-and-follow-up.R

Other numbers should left pad with zeros so that all have the same length:

-   *01*\_preface.docx

-   *02*\_introduction.docx

-   *03*\_method.docx

-   etc...

-   *20*\_appendix-09.docx

-   *21*\_appendix-10.docx

If you don't left pad you get:

-   10_figures.R

-   1_data-cleaning.R

-   2_fit-model.R

To make searching easy, include keywords to let a computer find files. Using the *slug* from the previous section is a good way to accomplish this.

## Challenge 1: Can you improve the file names?

Consider the following list of filenames in a research project (we have added a little bit of information about the content) and come up with new filenames that follow more closely the principles of good file naming:

| filename                                        | content                                                                         |
