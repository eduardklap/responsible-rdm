## Why Research Data Management?

In this course, we take a broad perspective and loosely define research data management (RDM) as concerning how you:

- re-use and/or create data and plan for its use;
- organize, structure, and name data;
- store data â€“ make it secure, provide access, store and back it up;
- share data with collaborators and more broadly, publish data and get cited. 

That is quite a lot to take in, so it makes sense to first ask ourselves why this is so important. The short answer is that devoting attention to RDM will make your research more robust and efficient. It might also help to prevent disaster. For that, we turn to some examples of data horrors in the next box.

### Data Horrors

Maybe you have experienced it first-hand, but there a lot of ways in which data can be lost or damaged. Data can be lost by accident, due to hardware failure or destruction, data theft is a thing, and it could end up into the wrong hands. Here are some examples of actual academic data horrors:

Increasingly, researchers are expected to make their research data available, in such a way that it is *as open as possible and as closed as necessary*. This is for example stated in the [Netherlands Code of Conduct for Research Integrity (VSNU, 2018)](https://doi.org/10.17026/dans-2cj-nvwu).
