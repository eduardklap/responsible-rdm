## Why Research Data Management?

In this course, we take a broad perspective and loosely define research data management (RDM) as concerning how you:

- re-use and/or create data and plan for its use;
- organize, structure, and name data;
- store data – make it secure, provide access, store and back it up;
- share data with collaborators and more broadly, publish data and get cited. 

That is quite a lot to take in, so it makes sense to first ask ourselves why this is so important. The short answer is that devoting attention to RDM will make your research more robust and efficient. It might also help to prevent disaster. For that, we turn to some examples of data horrors in the next box.

### Data Horrors

Maybe you have experienced it first-hand, but there a lot of ways in which data can be lost or damaged. Data can be lost by accident, due to hardware failure or destruction, data theft is a thing, and it could end up into the wrong hands. Here are some examples of actual academic data horrors:

Distraught Oklahoma University researcher says her stolen MacBook contains years of valuable data on prostate cancer. And no, she didn't back up.

No questions asked
$1000 reward
for anyone who leads to the safe return of
the stolen computer with all data intact
When, Where, What, Contact details.
PS. Thief, it is OK. Everybody makes mistake. Please return my computer safely for no questions asked - $1000 reward. If so, I would be forever grateful to you."}

This short article reports on a heartbreaking story of a researcher who says her stolen laptop contained years worth of data related to a possible cure for prostate cancer. No backup was made and a large amount of data was gone forever.

In May 2008, the Faculty of Architecture building at the TU Delft in the Netherlands was destroyed by fire that started in a coffee machine. Luckily, no one was physically hurt but a substantial part of the world-renowned architecture collection was lost (as well as personal archives of faculty staff).

In the 3 June issue, Science published the Report “Environmentally relevant concentrations of microplastic particles influence larval fish ecology” by Oona M. Lönnstedt and Peter Eklöv (1). The authors have notified Science of the theft of the computer on which the raw data for the paper were stored. These data were not backed up on any other device nor deposited in an appropriate repository. Science is publishing this Editorial Expression of Concern to alert our readers to the fact that no further data can be made available, beyond those already presented in the paper and its supplement, to enable readers to understand, assess, reproduce, or extend the conclusions of the paper.

In this letter, the Editor in Chief of *Science* magazine reports that he was informed by two scientists of "the theft of the computer on which the raw data for the paper were stored. These data were not backed up on any other device nor deposited in an appropriate repository." This means that this particular paper that was published in one of the world's leading scientific journals cannot be reproduced anymore, and that the data and results cannot be verified.

**Question: What do you think could be a risk for the academic community in these three examples of data horrors?**

:::


Increasingly, researchers are expected to make their research data available, in such a way that it is *as open as possible and as closed as necessary*. This is for example stated in the [Netherlands Code of Conduct for Research Integrity (VSNU, 2018)](https://doi.org/10.17026/dans-2cj-nvwu).
